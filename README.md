# wasm-matrix

A Matrix Effect in your terminal using AssemblyScript ðŸš€ and WASI ðŸ§© . Deployed to WAPM ðŸ“¦ .

Uses the [AssemblyScript WASI bindings](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/blob/master/std/assembly/bindings/wasi_unstable.ts), with some help from [Wasa](https://github.com/jedisct1/wasa).

# Table of Contents

# Usage

Install using [WAPM](https://wapm.io/):

`wapm install -g torch2424/wasm-matrix`

And then run `wasm-matrix`:

`wapm run wasm-matrix -l $LINES -c $COLUMNS`

# Caveats

Currently, in version `0.0.1` this isn't using the clock subscription, and using an old school `while(true)` loop to run the matrix. Thus, this will peg a core of CPU, wouldn't suggest running this on a cheap single core droplet (server). ðŸ™‚

# Contributing

Feel free to fork and submit PRs! Opening an issue is reccomended before starting any development, as a discussion would be nice on the idea / feature before writing code. Any help is much appreciated, and would be a ton of fun! ðŸŽ‰
